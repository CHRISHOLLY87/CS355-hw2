How to compile: There is a Makefile, so just type make to make and clean.

How to run it: Make with the makefile and then run the executable like normal. ./mysh for my shell and ./threads for threads.

Known Bugs and Limitations:
Due to the time delay for threads, it appears to hang, but it is not hanging and instead calculating. Too, I mod the random values to 0 to 9 to prevent overflow. Doing a CTRL-C exit from
Threads causes a memory leak, but Dianna said this is okay since it is a library function. and not me that caused it.

Additionally, I am using strtok and not strtok_r in mysh. Too, I do not know if I get a memory leak on SIGKILL. I valgrid was not saying I do, but since I cannot register SIGKILL
I was not able to free any memory when CTRL-Z was called.

File directory: N/A

Resources: I used stack overflow, use code from https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/ and looked at https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_strtok.htm, went to TA sessions,and worked with Kellie, Dylan, and Ju-Han.
