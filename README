How to compile: There is a Makefile, so just type make to make and clean.

How to run it: Make with the makefile and then run the executable like normal. ./mysh for my shell and ./threads for threads.

Known Bugs and Limitations:
Due to the time delay for threads, it appears to hang, but it is not hanging and instead calculating. Too, I mod the random values to 0 to 9 to prevent overflow. Finally, I get a
threads.c:166:22: warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size [-Wpointer-to-int-cast] error in my threads program from casting my void* to an int. I know, however, that it is
an int, so I do not think this is an issue. However, I wanted to document it.

Additionally, I am using strtok and not strtok_r in mysh.

Resources: I used stack overflow, use code from https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/ and looked at https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_strtok.htm, went to TA sessions,and worked with Kellie, Dylan, and Ju-Han.
